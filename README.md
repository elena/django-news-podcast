December 2013

This project has been on the mind of the author for several years and is motivated at this time because of the following:

- Recent discussions by DSF about how to effectively disseminate news.
- Recent [revival of Django Updates posts](https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2013/dec/09/reviving-django-update-posts/).
- Recent cessation of most recent incarnation of Django podcast: [Django Roundup](http://roundup.lincolnloop.com/).

## Discussion Guidelines

- Assume "Intelligent Listener"
- Sparse rather than chatty
- Provide technical background:
    - design decisions
    - details about decision-making process
    - friction about the decision and its resolution (or not)
- Deference to author:
    - person who created/worked on the feature
    - has greatest depth of knowledge
- Speak to personal expertise
- As a Reference:
    - "like a dictionary": won't teach you to read, but doesn't assume exaustive knowledge
- Don't speak if you don't have experience/expertise
- Stay "en piste"
- Minimal editorialising
- Minimal hyperbole
