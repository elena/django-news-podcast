## 2. Releases

### Minor Releases ##

_[**Django X.X.X** -- D-Mmm-YYYY]_

Follow-up bug fix release to the last major release: **Django 1.6** on 6-Nov-2013.

About 2 dozen minor bug and regression fixes, all with ticket numbers greater than #21350 and related mainly to corner-case or environment setup variations.

@@ Anything notable in 1.6.1?

### Major Releases ##

_[**Django X.X** -- D-Mmm-YYYY]_

_[[ or ]]_

The next major release of Django is _[X.X]_ scheduled for _[Mmm YYYY]_.

The _[X.X]_ Roadmap schedule is:

-  1.7 alpha -- January 20th (major feature freeze) -- which is to say that 1.7 will be comprised of whatever is in by this date.
-  1.7 beta -- March 6th (complete feature freeze)
-  1.7 release candidate -- May 1st (translations freeze)
-  Final release -- May 15th (assuming a second release candidate is not needed)

Andrew Godwin has stepped up to be the release manager for 1.7, he says:

> We will feature-freeze and branch off a release branch as we roll the beta, and any features that aren't in by this date _will_ have to wait.

More details can be found at [Version1.7Roadmap on the wiki](https://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/Version1.7Roadmap).
