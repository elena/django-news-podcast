Security advisory: ImageField abuse
We've received a report of a means of allowing an HTML file to be uploaded via Django's ImageField. As ImageField is expected to validate for a valid image file, this provides an attack vector for someone to upload a phishing form, something to steal cookies, or something else malicious. Unfortunately, we cannot offer a solution in Django itself. Rather, you need to take some steps in how you serve static files in order to mitigate this type of attack. These steps are now outlined in our security guide. We recommend that if you allow image uploads that you check your server's configuration against the guide.

Django’s media upload handling poses some vulnerabilities when that media is served in ways that do not follow security best practices. Specifically, an HTML file can be uploaded as an image if that file contains a valid PNG header followed by malicious HTML. This file will pass verification of the libraries that Django uses for ImageField image processing (PIL or Pillow). When this file is subsequently displayed to a user, it may be displayed as HTML depending on the type and configuration of your web server.


No bulletproof technical solution exists at the framework level to safely validate all user uploaded file content, however, there are some other steps you can take to mitigate these attacks:

One class of attacks can be prevented by always serving user uploaded content from a distinct Top Level Domain (TLD). This prevents any exploit blocked by same-origin policy protections such as cross site scripting. For example, if your site runs on example.com, you would want to serve uploaded content (the MEDIA_URL setting) from something like usercontent-example.com. It’s not sufficient to serve content from a subdomain like usercontent.example.com.
Beyond this, applications may choose to define a whitelist of allowable file extensions for user uploaded files and configure the web server to only serve such files.

As always with web development: Take care with any user uploaded files.

Thanks Rolo Mawlabaux for the report.

Summary of Django Dev this month
----

16th Dec: Aymeric Augustin
App-loading reloaded (12)
#3591 February 2007

Summary: As he says there isn't really any tldr here, it's too detailed a project to gloss over as Many related issues have been closed as duplicates of #3591. As a consequence, its scope has become frighteningly ambitious over the years. This is certainly one of the reasons why it hasn’t been resolved yet.

Aymeric has broken the ticket up and his pre-Xmas goals have been as follows:

1) Allow apps without a models module or package
2) Provide verbose_name for the admin
3) Provide a reliable initialization signal

He has a range of other ideas and goals also which are worth reading.

Call for Volunteers: DjangoCon US 2014 Website
It might be 9 months away, but work is already underway planning DjangoCon US 2014. One of the first pieces of work required is the conference website. Last year's website design was met with some criticism, so this year, The Open Bastion (the organizers of DjangoCon US) is calling for volunteers.

If you are interested in helping out with the design of this year's conference website, jump onto the DjangoCon organizers mailing list, or email Steve Holden from Open Bastion directly (steve@holdenweb.com).

If website design isn't your thing, but you're still interested in volunteering, you're also welcome to join the organisers mailing list -- we'll need lots more volunteers before the big event arrives!

Kogan donates A$10,000 to the DSF
The Django Software Foundation (DSF) is proud to announce that we have just received an A$10,000 (around US$9,000) donation from Kogan.com.

Kogan.com is one of Australia's most recognisable entrepreneurial brands and values technology at its core. Kogan selected Django as its website platform in 2006 because of it’s scalable design, flexibility and burgeoning open source community. Django has been (and still is) Kogan’s platform of choice throughout the company’s rapid growth as Australia’s largest online retailer.

Kogan & its software engineering team give a big shout out to everyone in the Django community and extend a special thanks to the team behind significant ORM speed improvements in the Django 1.6 release! The team is excited to have built several world-first e-commerce innovations on a platform that is so enjoyable to work with!

The DSF will use these funds to help support Django development sprints, to provide financial aid to people in the Django community to attend Django and Python events, and to support any other activities that benefit the Django community.

A huge thanks to Ruslan Kogan and his team for this generous contribution!
