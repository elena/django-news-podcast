<hr><p>[ANNOUNCE] Django 1.7 alpha 1 released</p>

<p>Posted by James Bennett on January 22, 2014</p>

<p>As part of the Django 1.7 release process, today we've released Django 1.7 alpha 1, a preview/testing package that represents the first stage in the 1.7 release cycle and an opportunity for you to try out some of the changes coming in Django 1.7.</p>

<p>Django 1.7 will bring several major new features to Django, along with a host of other improvements. Highlights include a schema-migration framework, a new validation tool to help identify and fix common errors, a complete refactoring of how Django identifies and loads applications, and support for custom database lookups.</p>

<p>For full details, see the in-development 1.7 release notes.</p>

<p>As with all alpha and beta packages, this is not for production use. But if you'd like to take some of the new features for a spin, or to help find and fix bugs (which should be reported to the issue tracker), you can grab a copy of the alpha package from our downloads page. And as always, signed MD5 and SHA1 checksums of the 1.7 alpha package are available.</p>

<p>In addition to the changes covered in the release notes, there are two already-noted issues to be aware of when using the 1.7 alpha package:</p>

<ul>
<li>Issue #21856 -- an empty value for the DATABASES setting will cause a crash.</li>
<li>Issue #21831 -- using the contenttypes package or GenericForeignKey will fail unless django.contrib.auth is in INSTALLED_APPS.</li>
</ul><p>Both of these will be fixed prior to the final 1.7 release.</p>

<p>Additionally, users of South (a popular third-party package for schema migrations) should note that South is not compatible with the 1.7 alpha.</p>

<hr><p>Adrian and Jacob retiring as Django BDFLs
Written by Adrian Holovaty on January 13, 2014</p>

<p>Adrian said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Since July 2005, when Django was open-sourced, Jacob Kaplan-Moss and I have been the two Benevolent Dictators For Life (BDFLs) of the project. Today we're both retiring from our formal BDFL roles, given that (1) we don't have the time for it that we once had and (2) Django is in great shape with a vibrant community of contributors.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>"If you're a Django user, though, have no fear. Honestly, this title seems like a big change "on paper," but in reality it won't change much. "</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jacob said:</p>

<p>We reject kings, presidents and voting. We believe in rough consensus and running code.</p>

<p>—The Tao of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For me, this has been a long time coming — I’ve been thinking about this for at least a year. .. this is a similar to a lot of the changes we’ve made over the years: it’s a formalization, and a naming, of what’s already happened.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think this decision goes to show how strong, humble, dedicated and honest our community and particularly the leaders of our community are. This is perhaps one of the elements which makes the Django project as strong as it is.</p>

<p>In softer news:</p>

<p>On the 10-Jan-2014 Audrey Roy tweeted that: " at the end of 2013, she married <a href="https://github.com/pydanny" class="user-mention">@pydanny</a>."</p>

<p>I believe that they'll now both be going by the surname "Roy Greenfeld".</p>

<p>Some of their notable collaborative acheivements since they met through PyCon diversity grant in 2010:</p>

<ul>
<li>Audrey founded PyLadies</li>
<li>Co-authored Two Scoops</li>
<li>responsible for DjangoPackages as well as both Python Cookiecutter and Django Cookiecutter</li>

<a name="django-sprint-in-amsterdam-the-netherlands" class="anchor" href="#django-sprint-in-amsterdam-the-netherlands"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Django sprint in Amsterdam, The Netherlands</h4>

<p>Posted by Russell Keith-Magee and Erik Romijn on January 23, 2014</p>

<p>We're very happy to announce that a two-day Django sprint will take place on February 22-23 in Amsterdam, Netherlands. This event is organized by the Dutch Django Association.</p>

<p>The venue is the office of TravelBird in the center of Amsterdam. The sprint will start on Saturday, February 22rd at 10:00 CET and and finish on Sunday, February 23 around 22:00 CET.</p>

<p>With the help of the Django Software Foundation and the Dutch Django Association we will have two core developers on site: Baptiste Mispelon and Daniele Procida. Daniele will also be doing his famed “Don’t be afraid to commit” workshop, which will take people new to contributing to Django through the entire contribution process with real tickets. So please don’t hesitate to join even if you’ve never contributed to Django before.</p>

<p>The first beta for Django 1.7 should come out shortly after the sprint, so we can still contribute bugfixes to it.</p>

<p>If you’re unable to come to Amsterdam, you're welcome to contribute to the sprint online. Sprinters and core developers will be available in the #django-sprint IRC channel on FreeNode.</p>

<p>We hope you can join us and help make the sprint as successful as possible!</p>

<a name="djangocon-europe-2014-tickets-are-now-on-sale" class="anchor" href="#djangocon-europe-2014-tickets-are-now-on-sale"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>DjangoCon Europe 2014: tickets are now on sale</h4>

<p>Tickets for DjangoCon Europe 2014, which will be held on the Île des Embiez, are now on sale!</p>

<p>There's an initial run of 50 early tickets, after which prices will go up.</p>

<p>What's different this year is that all tickets include your accommodation and your meals.</p>

<p>It can be a hassle to book suitable accommodation in a place you don't know well, never mind try to work out a budget in advance for your meals and other expenses.</p>

<p>Now consider that this year's DjangoCon Europe will take place on the French Riviera - a gorgeous place to stay, but not exactly noted for being an inexpensive place to visit.</p>

<p>This year, you don't need to worry about finding suitable and affordable accommodation, or where to eat or how much it will cost, because we have taken care of it for you.</p>

<p>As well as saving you the time and trouble of doing it yourself, this will make it much less expensive than it would otherwise have been, because we've been able to negotiate all these prices on your behalf.</p>

<p>So, the basic cost for the event, including two nights' accommodation, two breakfasts, three lunches and two evening meals is a mere €610 at the early bird rate (and only €670 thereafter).</p>

<p>Users Group As anyone who is familiar with the French Riviera can tell you, that's very good value, and it includes the entire conference too!</p>

<p>On top of the basic ticket there are various options:</p>

<p>Early arrival
If you prefer to arrive on Monday afternoon or evening rather than Tuesday morning, you can purchase an extra night (dinner and breakfast included of course).</p>

<p>Sprints
Sprinters should purchase a ticket for the extra two nights and four meals.</p>

<p>Partners and family
Finally, it's not often that one gets to visit a place as special as the Île des Embiez, so make the most of it. You're invited to bring your partner and family!</p>

<p>The island has beaches, nature reserves, sporting facilities, some splendid wildlife - and there are no cars on the island, so it's a lovely environment.</p>

<p>Your partner can join you by purchasing the appropriate Companion ticket. There's no charge for children under four. We're working out prices for older children.</p>

<p>We often talk of the Python/Django family or community, but we're really serious about embracing a wider community - let's make this DjangoCon a truly inclusive family affair!</p>

<p>Djangonaut couples
If both you and your partner wish to attend the conference, you should register as an Attendee and Companion, rather than purchasing two full tickets. Note that this is aimed at couples, and that only double beds are provided.</p>

<a name="django-updates" class="anchor" href="#django-updates"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Django Updates</h3>

<p>New series of posts from PyDanny about using <code>pytest</code>.</p>

<p>Did you know?
As of 1.6, Django supports persistend DB connections. They're disabled by default, and can be enabled per-DB in your DATABASES setting.</p>

<p>Turning this on can save you some time at the beginning of every request. The time varies, depending on which DBMS, if you're using SSL, and the latency between your DB server and app servers, but I've seen measurements between 25ms and 450ms.</p>

<p>For more details see the docs.</p>

<p>Did you know?
You can use F expressions in your model fields, not just in filter() statements.</p>

<p>So, if you want to increment an integer field on your model, but want to avoid the obvious race condition, you can use:</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>from django.db.models import F
product = Product.objects.get(name='Venezuelan Beaver Cheese')
product.number_sold = F('number_sold') + 1
product.save()
For more detail, see Updating attributes based on existing fields.</p>

<p>Brief and loose summary of what was discussed on the Django Development mailing list during the last 28 days (excluding announcements and support enquiries).</p>

<p>The purpose of this section is to provide a summary of what's been discussed in case something you're particularly interested in.</p>

<p>This is very much a summary, lacking in context, quite incomplete and potentially entirely erroneous so please read and contribute to the actual threads if there's anything mentioned that's of interest to you.</p>

<p>This last few weeks was dominated by talk about the new release features.</p>

<p>Particularly the 5 big features going in to 1.7:</p>

<ul>
<li>Schema-migrations</li>
<li>App refactor</li>
<li>Custom lookup</li>
<li>Advanced pre-fetching</li>
<li>Validations</li>

<p>Aymeric Augustin has very publicly worked on the App Loading refactor, giving a detailed plan at the start, regular updates, and a slew of code improvements.</p>

<p>This work has focused on changing how we think about INSTALLED_APPS. The most noticeable changes are:</p>

<p>Allow apps without a models module or package
Provide a verbose name, for example for the admin
My personal favourite goal "Provide a reliable initialization signal" was, unfortunately, not achieved in the time frame, but looks to be within sight. All of the resulting tasks are now in tickets with the keyword "app-loading", ready for the wider community to tackle.</p>

<p>Daniel Sokolowski 22-Dec-11
Asking about where to define signals for an app. Back then the word from RKM was:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The root problem is that there isn't a single reliable place to put "app startup" logic. With the current way Django handles apps, there isn't a single solution that will work everywhere, which one of the reasons that the docs are silent on the issue.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Coincidentally this thread was re-dug up on 15-Jan, and Aymeric could promptly state that "It's fixed in 1.7" and point to both 'signals' in the docs and to the app refactor commits and discussions.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/django/django/commits/master/docs/ref/signals.txt">https://github.com/django/django/commits/master/docs/ref/signals.txt</a></p>

<p>So for the record folks:</p>

<p>As at 1.7 there is an official, "Django way" for where to put signals, where to put handlers, where to wire them up, and how to test all that stuff.</p>

<p>There's a commit from Aymeric called: "Updated advice on connecting signals at startup."</p>

<p>The hardest of problems: naming things.</p>

<p>During the app_loading refactor, I introduced a method to test if a given application is enabled, and I named it <code>has_app</code>.</p>

<p>Its main uses are detecting misconfigurations and skipping tests.</p>

<p>Up to Django 1.4: every Django project was vulnerable to double import problems: since PYTHONPATH contained both a directory and its parent, the same module could get imported twice through different paths.</p>

<p>As of Django 1.6: there’s no built-in support for setting PYTHONPATH like that. However, some users may still be setting it manually to avoid fixing their imports.</p>

<p>Django still contains some ad-hoc mechanisms to work around the consequences of this poor setup, notably
ModelBase, the metaclass for Model: defining a class that inherits from Model can return an existing class instead of creating a new one.</p>

<p>He'd be inclined to do it immediately, shouldn't be too hard, but being <em>not backwards compatible</em> will create deprecation path to 1.9.</p>

<p>As the incompatible behaviour predates the LTS version 1.4 (to paraphrase Last comment on 7-Jan): Double imports will be killed with fire.</p>

<p>Ticket: #21841 Add DatabaseFeature to disable schema migrations (new New feature)</p>

<p>A discussion of this ticket on IRC raised</p>

<p>the question about whether schema migration support is required for a database backend to be compliant with Django 1.7.</p>

<p>The scenario that prompted this ticket is that my primary project will not use Django for migrations because it interfaces with a legacy database with other tools and a DBA that manage the database schema. The "able to support schema migrations" bit relates to NoSQL, which doesn't necessarily have a strict schema.</p>

<p>First off - this isn't critical for 1.7 alpha - I'm raising it now because I've been in this space for the last couple of days as a result of the working on the check framework. I suspect any changes stemming from this discussion can be landed in the beta period without major problems.</p>

<p>Also - Aymeric - you've done a great job with this app loading work. I didn't get much of a chance to follow along as it was unfolding, but the resultant work has been a pleasure to work with.</p>

<p>With one exception :-)</p>

<p>We've now got AppConfig objects for each app (e.g., contrib.admin). Those AppConfig objects can have ready() methods that invoke startup logic. This is all great stuff that has been a long time coming.</p>

<p><em>But</em></p>

<p>From a backwards compatibility perspective, there seems to be a gap in the way AppConfig objects are instantiated.</p>

<p>After discussion on IRC, the following was decided (as posted by Florian Apolloner):</p>

<p>We are not going to support setuptools and distutils, this makes the setupprocess difficult to debug and test imo.
Given Donald's "okay" we might switch to setuptools completely
