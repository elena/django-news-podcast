Releases\r\n\r\n### Minor Releases ##\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n[ANNOUNCE] Django 1.7 alpha 1 released\r\n\r\nPosted by James Bennett on January 22, 2014\r\n\r\nAs part of the Django 1.7 release process, today we've released Django 1.7 alpha 1, a preview/testing package that represents the first stage in the 1.7 release cycle and an opportunity for you to try out some of the changes coming in Django 1.7.\r\n\r\nDjango 1.7 will bring several major new features to Django, along with a host of other improvements. Highlights include a schema-migration framework, a new validation tool to help identify and fix common errors, a complete refactoring of how Django identifies and loads applications, and support for custom database lookups.\r\n\r\nFor full details, see the in-development 1.7 release notes.\r\n\r\nAs with all alpha and beta packages, this is not for production use. But if you'd like to take some of the new features for a spin, or to help find and fix bugs (which should be reported to the issue tracker), you can grab a copy of the alpha package from our downloads page. And as always, signed MD5 and SHA1 checksums of the 1.7 alpha package are available.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the changes covered in the release notes, there are two already-noted issues to be aware of when using the 1.7 alpha package:\r\n\r\n- Issue #21856 -- an empty value for the DATABASES setting will cause a crash.\r\n- Issue #21831 -- using the contenttypes package or GenericForeignKey will fail unless django.contrib.auth is in INSTALLED_APPS.\r\n\r\nBoth of these will be fixed prior to the final 1.7 release.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, users of South (a popular third-party package for schema migrations) should note that South is not compatible with the 1.7 alpha.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n[Interview with Andrew Godwin:\r\n\r\n- Release Management\r\n- Release Cycle\r\n- Features\r\n- Schema Migrations\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Interview with Russell Keith-Magee:\r\n\r\n- Validation/System Check framework\r\n- Google Summer of Code (GSoC) process and applications\r\n- Django Trademark\r\n]\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOther non-Django recent releases to be aware of:\r\n\r\nSentry 6.4.4 -- 29-Dec\r\nPillow 2.3.0 -- 1-Jan\r\nDjango Debug Toolbar 1.0.1 -- 7-Jan\r\nDjango Extensions 1.3.0 -- 7-Jan\r\n\r\n\r\n## 3. News\r\n\r\nThere was no official \"news\" items so far this month, but there was one of the largest bit of \"unofficial\" news that there's been perhaps in years:\r\n\r\n### Other News\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAdrian and Jacob retiring as Django BDFLs\r\nWritten by Adrian Holovaty on January 13, 2014\r\n\r\nAdrian said:\r\n\r\n> Since July 2005, when Django was open-sourced, Jacob Kaplan-Moss and I have been the two Benevolent Dictators For Life (BDFLs) of the project. Today we're both retiring from our formal BDFL roles, given that (1) we don't have the time for it that we once had and (2) Django is in great shape with a vibrant community of contributors.\r\n>\r\n> ...\r\n>\r\n> \"If you're a Django user, though, have no fear. Honestly, this title seems like a big change \"on paper,\" but in reality it won't change much. \"\r\n>\r\n\r\nJacob said:\r\n\r\nWe reject kings, presidents and voting. We believe in rough consensus and running code.\r\n\r\n—The Tao of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)\r\n\r\n> For me, this has been a long time coming — I’ve been thinking about this for at least a year. .. this is a similar to a lot of the changes we’ve made over the years: it’s a formalization, and a naming, of what’s already happened.\r\n\r\nI think this decision goes to show how strong, humble, dedicated and honest our community and particularly the leaders of our community are. This is perhaps one of the elements which makes the Django project as strong as it is.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n##### Roy Greenfeld marriage\r\n\r\nIn softer news:\r\n\r\nOn the 10-Jan-2014 Audrey Roy tweeted that: \" at the end of 2013, she married @pydanny.\"\r\n\r\nI believe that they'll now both be going by the surname \"Roy Greenfeld\".\r\n\r\nSome of their notable collaborative acheivements since they met through PyCon diversity grant in 2010:\r\n\r\n- Audrey founded PyLadies\r\n- Co-authored Two Scoops\r\n- responsible for DjangoPackages as well as both Python Cookiecutter and Django Cookiecutter\r\n- keynoted several conferences\r\n\r\nTireless work: blogs, talks\r\n\r\n##### Two Scoops of Django 1.6\r\n\r\nThis has not stopped them from being their usual prolific and generous selves, on the same day they tweeted that;\r\n\r\n\"very first proof of **Two Scoops of Django 1.6** should arrive \" to them shortly. Looking forward to that release and they tell me it should be available in _[SOON]_\r\n\r\n\"It's pretty likely\"\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n##### KickStarter: \"Real Python: Advanced Web Development, featuring Django 1.6\" by Jeremy Johnson\r\n\r\nrealpython.com tutorials kickstarter\r\n\r\nSuccessfully funded on 15 January\r\n\r\n1,446 backers\r\n$50,001 pledged (of $3,500 goal)\r\n\r\nThis is for students, developers, entrepreneurs, and really anyone who wants to learn web development best practices via Python and Django 1.6 in order to start developing their own web development projects. Technologies/languages covered: Python, Django, Heroku, Git, HTML5, CSS, JavaScript/jQuery, MongoDB, Postgres, SQL, Github, Bootstrap 3, REST, AJAX, Vim, Selenium ...\r\n\r\nThe Real Python team has successfully delivered two other KickStarter projects.\r\nWe've done this before and know what to expect - and we're doing it again! Our timeline is clear and realistic. We will deliver on this project.\r\n\r\n\r\nBack in Sept 2012, Kenneth Love.\r\n$13,354 pledged (of $5,000 goal)\r\n\r\n## 4. Conferences/Events\r\n\r\n#### Django sprint in Amsterdam, The Netherlands\r\n\r\nPosted by Russell Keith-Magee and Erik Romijn on January 23, 2014\r\n\r\nWe're very happy to announce that a two-day Django sprint will take place on February 22-23 in Amsterdam, Netherlands. This event is organized by the Dutch Django Association.\r\n\r\nThe venue is the office of TravelBird in the center of Amsterdam. The sprint will start on Saturday, February 22rd at 10:00 CET and and finish on Sunday, February 23 around 22:00 CET.\r\n\r\nWith the help of the Django Software Foundation and the Dutch Django Association we will have two core developers on site: Baptiste Mispelon and Daniele Procida. Daniele will also be doing his famed “Don’t be afraid to commit” workshop, which will take people new to contributing to Django through the entire contribution process with real tickets. So please don’t hesitate to join even if you’ve never contributed to Django before.\r\n\r\nThe first beta for Django 1.7 should come out shortly after the sprint, so we can still contribute bugfixes to it.\r\n\r\nIf you’re unable to come to Amsterdam, you're welcome to contribute to the sprint online. Sprinters and core developers will be available in the #django-sprint IRC channel on FreeNode.\r\n\r\nWe hope you can join us and help make the sprint as successful as possible!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### DjangoCon Europe 2014: tickets are now on sale\r\nTickets for DjangoCon Europe 2014, which will be held on the Île des Embiez, are now on sale!\r\n\r\nThere's an initial run of 50 early tickets, after which prices will go up.\r\n\r\nWhat's different this year is that all tickets include your accommodation and your meals.\r\n\r\nIt can be a hassle to book suitable accommodation in a place you don't know well, never mind try to work out a budget in advance for your meals and other expenses.\r\n\r\nNow consider that this year's DjangoCon Europe will take place on the French Riviera - a gorgeous place to stay, but not exactly noted for being an inexpensive place to visit.\r\n\r\nThis year, you don't need to worry about finding suitable and affordable accommodation, or where to eat or how much it will cost, because we have taken care of it for you.\r\n\r\nAs well as saving you the time and trouble of doing it yourself, this will make it much less expensive than it would otherwise have been, because we've been able to negotiate all these prices on your behalf.\r\n\r\nSo, the basic cost for the event, including two nights' accommodation, two breakfasts, three lunches and two evening meals is a mere €610 at the early bird rate (and only €670 thereafter).\r\n\r\nUsers Group As anyone who is familiar with the French Riviera can tell you, that's very good value, and it includes the entire conference too!\r\n\r\nOn top of the basic ticket there are various options:\r\n\r\nEarly arrival\r\nIf you prefer to arrive on Monday afternoon or evening rather than Tuesday morning, you can purchase an extra night (dinner and breakfast included of course).\r\n\r\nSprints\r\nSprinters should purchase a ticket for the extra two nights and four meals.\r\n\r\nPartners and family\r\nFinally, it's not often that one gets to visit a place as special as the Île des Embiez, so make the most of it. You're invited to bring your partner and family!\r\n\r\nThe island has beaches, nature reserves, sporting facilities, some splendid wildlife - and there are no cars on the island, so it's a lovely environment.\r\n\r\nYour partner can join you by purchasing the appropriate Companion ticket. There's no charge for children under four. We're working out prices for older children.\r\n\r\nWe often talk of the Python/Django family or community, but we're really serious about embracing a wider community - let's make this DjangoCon a truly inclusive family affair!\r\n\r\nDjangonaut couples\r\nIf both you and your partner wish to attend the conference, you should register as an Attendee and Companion, rather than purchasing two full tickets. Note that this is aimed at couples, and that only double beds are provided.\r\n\r\nPosted by Daniele Procida on December 31, 2013\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Django Weekend Cardiff\r\n\r\nDjango Weekend Cardiff <https://djangoweekend.org/> is completely sold out.\r\n\r\nOur open day remains open however, and you're invited to attend the numerous talks, tutorials and demonstrations in the programme.\r\n\r\n<https://djangoweekend.org/tutorials-demonstrations/>\r\n\r\nThere are fifteen different sessions in the open day programme, on all kinds of subjects.

Things *YOU* can do/Requests/Call outs\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Bring out your \"interesting\" Schemamigrations\r\nNow is the time to try out 1.7, as Andrew said in the interview he's looking specifically for exotic use cases that can be debugged and any feedback about improving the UI.\r\n\r\n#### Give Class based custom Lookups a try, write about your experiences\r\nClass based lookups (12-Jan thread) -- Anssi, new #16187 pull#2019 -- documentation needs work, install 1.7a take them out for a spin, add to our docs!\r\n\r\n    from django.db.models import Lookup, Extract\r\n\t_[define your custom lookup]_\r\n\r\n\t_[register]_\r\n\r\n#### Give back using your creative ability: make your django merchandise dreams a reality for the DSF\r\n\r\nIf you have any visual arts skills and you've ever had any ideas about Django t-shirts, or actually any bit of merchandise with a Django logo on it: now is your chance!\r\n\r\nThe DSF is Looking for artwork to emblazon on things to sell as fundraising for the DSF, just email [foundation@djangoproject.com](foundation@djangoproject.com)\r\n\r\nIf you have any community requests for volunteers, support, sponsorship or other projects, please email [scoop@djangoproject.com](scoop@djangoproject.com) to be posted here.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Django Updates\r\n\r\nNew series of posts from PyDanny about using `pytest`.\r\n\r\nDid you know?\r\nAs of 1.6, Django supports persistend DB connections. They're disabled by default, and can be enabled per-DB in your DATABASES setting.\r\n\r\nTurning this on can save you some time at the beginning of every request. The time varies, depending on which DBMS, if you're using SSL, and the latency between your DB server and app servers, but I've seen measurements between 25ms and 450ms.\r\n\r\nFor more details see the docs.\r\n\r\nDid you know?\r\nYou can use F expressions in your model fields, not just in filter() statements.\r\n\r\nSo, if you want to increment an integer field on your model, but want to avoid the obvious race condition, you can use:\r\n\r\n>>> from django.db.models import F\r\n>>> product = Product.objects.get(name='Venezuelan Beaver Cheese')\r\n>>> product.number_sold = F('number_sold') + 1\r\n>>> product.save()\r\nFor more detail, see Updating attributes based on existing fields.\r\n\r\n### Show Notes\r\n\r\nThese show notes are \"open source\" on github so please be sure to make any corrections or additions at: [github.com/elena/django-news-podcast](https://github.com/elena/django-news-podcast/blob/master/9998_2014-01-26.md)\r\n\r\n[brief howto help]\r\n\r\n\r\n## Lastly: Summary of Django Dev this month\r\n\r\nBrief and loose summary of what was discussed on the Django Development mailing list during the last 28 days (excluding announcements and support enquiries).\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this section is to provide a summary of what's been discussed in case something you're particularly interested in.\r\n\r\nThis is very much a summary, lacking in context, quite incomplete and potentially entirely erroneous so please read and contribute to the actual threads if there's anything mentioned that's of interest to you.\r\n\r\nThis last few weeks was dominated by talk about the new release features.\r\n\r\nParticularly the 5 big features going in to 1.7:\r\n\r\n- Schema-migrations\r\n- App refactor\r\n- Custom lookup\r\n- Advanced pre-fetching\r\n- Validations\r\n\r\n\r\n\\# (1) Re: python-social-auth partial pipeline can not resume |Jan 11 By Karen Tracey 1 post 25 views<br>\r\n\\# (2) New to Django - Question: All registered users to post content... |Jan 6 By Retnuh 2 posts 49 views<br>\r\n\\# (3) Consider reopening ticket #11385 |Jan 8 By Andres Osinski 3 posts 70 views<br>\r\n\\# (3) django_bash_completion in Pypi Package |Jan 7 By Brett Nekolny 3 posts 74 views<br>\r\n\\# (1) Re: Django doesn't give any feedback if it cannot connect to a DB |Jan 11 By Ramiro Morales 1 post 35 views<br>\r\n\\# (2) Patch fix for #21430 : Exception to be raised when unpickiling QuerySet across unsupported django version |Jan 18 By Prasoon Shukla 2 posts 44 views<br>\r\n\\# (2) permit global change of BaseForm.label_suffix |Jan 15 By Tilman Koschnick 2 posts 49 views<br>\r\n\\# (3) Consider allowing customization of ModelForm's init parameters in contrib.admin |Jan 16 By tyrion-mx 3 posts 43 views<br>\r\n\\# (3) Re: Digest for django-d...@googlegroups.com - 1 Message in 1 Topic |Jan 3 By shmengie 3 posts 50 views<br>\r\n\\# (3) Should exceptions in dev server appear as tracebacks in the console by default? |Jan 16 By Harry Percival 3 posts 93 views<br>\r\n\\# (3) python querry on firebug extention . |Jan 13 By JAI PRAKASH SINGH 3 posts 41 views<br>\r\n\\# (2) Self-referenced template recursion handling |12/30/13 By unai 26 posts 251 views<br>\r\n\\# (1) Fixing #10811 Prevet assigning of unsaved model to Foreign Key |Jan 25 By anubhav joshi 1 post 20 views<br>\r\n\\# (1) Saving deleted code from Django source code |Jan 6 By Vajrasky Kok 3 posts 117 views<br>\r\n\\# (5) Website integrated mobile app for disaster |Jan 12 By unk...@googlegroups.com 5 posts 87 views<br>\r\n(1) Django sprint in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, Feb 22/23 |Jan 23 By Erik Romijn 1 post 24 views<br>\r\n(2) Merging GSoC 2013 - Validation Refactor |Jan 20 By Russell Keith-Magee 2 posts 78 views<br>\r\n(2) [ANNOUNCE] Django 1.7 alpha 1 released |Jan 23 By James Bennett 2 posts 53 views<br>\r\n(3) django.core.checks.register shouldn't be (primarily) a decorator |Jan 23 By Shai Berger 3 posts 44 views<br>\r\n(5) Is it a mistake on docs for django 1.5? |Jan 21 By Leonardo Borges Avelino 5 posts 51 views<br>\r\n\r\n\r\n## Big Features\r\n\r\n\r\n### App Reloading\r\n\r\n#### (31) App-loading reloaded |Jan 14 By Aymeric Augustin 47 posts 804 views\r\nAymeric Augustin has very publicly worked on the App Loading refactor, giving a detailed plan at the start, regular updates, and a slew of code improvements.\r\n\r\nThis work has focused on changing how we think about INSTALLED_APPS. The most noticeable changes are:\r\n\r\nAllow apps without a models module or package\r\nProvide a verbose name, for example for the admin\r\nMy personal favourite goal \"Provide a reliable initialization signal\" was, unfortunately, not achieved in the time frame, but looks to be within sight. All of the resulting tasks are now in tickets with the keyword \"app-loading\", ready for the wider community to tackle.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### (8) Thoughts on defining and autoimporting signals.py |Jan 16 By Daniel Sokolowski 8 posts 396 views\r\nDaniel Sokolowski 22-Dec-11\r\nAsking about where to define signals for an app. Back then the word from RKM was:\r\n\r\n> The root problem is that there isn't a single reliable place to put \"app startup\" logic. With the current way Django handles apps, there isn't a single solution that will work everywhere, which one of the reasons that the docs are silent on the issue.\r\n\r\nCoincidentally this thread was re-dug up on 15-Jan, and Aymeric could promptly state that \"It's fixed in 1.7\" and point to both 'signals' in the docs and to the app refactor commits and discussions.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/django/django/commits/master/docs/ref/signals.txt\r\n\r\nSo for the record folks:\r\n\r\nAs at 1.7 there is an official, \"Django way\" for where to put signals, where to put handlers, where to wire them up, and how to test all that stuff.\r\n\r\nThere's a commit from Aymeric called: \"Updated advice on connecting signals at startup.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n#### (16) Renaming apps.has\\_app |Jan 7 By Aymeric Augustin 16 posts 90 views\r\nThe hardest of problems: naming things.\r\n\r\n> During the app_loading refactor, I introduced a method to test if a given application is enabled, and I named it `has_app`.\r\n\r\nIts main uses are detecting misconfigurations and skipping tests.\r\n\r\nTried: .installed .has\\_app .has\\_installed .have\\_installed\r\n\r\n_is\\_installed_\r\n\r\n\r\n#### (6) Forbidding double imports |Jan 7 By Aymeric Augustin 6 posts 101 views\r\n\r\nUp to Django 1.4: every Django project was vulnerable to double import problems: since PYTHONPATH contained both a directory and its parent, the same module could get imported twice through different paths.\r\n\r\nAs of Django 1.6: there’s no built-in support for setting PYTHONPATH like that. However, some users may still be setting it manually to avoid fixing their imports.\r\n\r\nDjango still contains some ad-hoc mechanisms to work around the consequences of this poor setup, notably\r\nModelBase, the metaclass for Model: defining a class that inherits from Model can return an existing class instead of creating a new one.\r\n\r\nHe'd be inclined to do it immediately, shouldn't be too hard, but being *not backwards compatible* will create deprecation path to 1.9.\r\n\r\nAs the incompatible behaviour predates the LTS version 1.4 (to paraphrase Last comment on 7-Jan): Double imports will be killed with fire.\r\n\r\n### Schema Migrations\r\n\r\n\r\n#### (13) 1.7 Schema migrations and AUTH_PROFILE_MODULE / get_profile() deprecation |Jan 25 By Brian Neal 13 posts 71 views<br>\r\n\r\n#### (13) Must a Django Database Support Migrations? |Jan 23 By Michael Manfre 13 posts 89 views<br>\r\n\r\nTicket: #21841 Add DatabaseFeature to disable schema migrations (new New feature)\r\n\r\nA discussion of this ticket on IRC raised\r\n\r\nthe question about whether schema migration support is required for a database backend to be compliant with Django 1.7.\r\n\r\nThe scenario that prompted this ticket is that my primary project will not use Django for migrations because it interfaces with a legacy database with other tools and a DBA that manage the database schema. The \"able to support schema migrations\" bit relates to NoSQL, which doesn't necessarily have a strict schema.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### (12) Migrations and swappable models/AUTH_USER_MODEL |Jan 12 By Andrew Godwin 12 posts 123 views\r\n\r\nLong and technically deep discussion about some of the specific intricacies of applying \"swappable models\" migrations. A major feature of 1.7\r\n\r\nSwappable models are an interesting and powerful feature that was previously removed from Django.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Custom lookup\r\n\r\n#### (2) Class based lookups |Jan 12 By Anssi Kääriäinen 2 posts 46 views\r\n\r\nClass based lookups -- Anssi, new #16187 pull#2019 -- documentation needs work, install 1.7a take them out for a spin, add to our docs!\r\n\r\n    from django.db.models import Lookup, Extract\r\n\t_[define your custom lookup]_\r\n\r\n\t_[register]_\r\n\r\n\r\n- Advanced pre-fetching\r\n\r\n\r\n### Validations\r\n\r\n#### (24) App-loading: Pragmatic concerns about default AppConfig objects and ready() implementations (24) |Jan 25 By Russell Keith-Magee 24 posts 178 views\r\n\r\nFirst off - this isn't critical for 1.7 alpha - I'm raising it now because I've been in this space for the last couple of days as a result of the working on the check framework. I suspect any changes stemming from this discussion can be landed in the beta period without major problems.\r\n\r\nAlso - Aymeric - you've done a great job with this app loading work.
